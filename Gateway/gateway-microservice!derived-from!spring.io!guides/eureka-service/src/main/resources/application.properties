# [Baeldung]:eureka-server - Important property since we're running the eureka server in a local machine. Otherwise, we may end up creating an unavailable replica within the Eureka server – messing up the client's heartbeat counts (See https://www.baeldung.com/eureka-self-preservation-renewal#server).

# [Baeldung]:eureka-server - The server calculates the expected heartbeats per minute from all the registered clients – the default value is 0.85 (See https://www.baeldung.com/eureka-self-preservation-renewal#server).
# [N]:eureka-server -  Used to get rid of the following warning in the eureka dashboard: "EMERGENCY! EUREKA MAY BE INCORRECTLY CLAIMING INSTANCES ARE UP WHEN THEY'RE NOT. RENEWALS ARE LESSER THAN THRESHOLD AND HENCE THE INSTANCES ARE NOT BEING EXPIRED JUST TO BE SAFE."
